# 🧠 Sentiment Analyzer using Hugging Face Transformers

This project is a lightweight **Sentiment Analysis Web App** built using [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) and [Gradio](https://gradio.app/). It allows users to input a text and receive a real-time classification of the sentiment as **Positive** or **Negative**, along with a confidence score.
